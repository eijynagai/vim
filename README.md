# vim

Configuration file `.vimrc` can be checked [here](https://github.com/eijynagai/dotfiles). Other specific configuration I have done are described bellow:

- [JEDI-VIM](https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim/blob/master/doc/jedi-vim.txt): Python completion with Vim. 
- [Supertab](https://github.com/ervandew/supertab): Vim plugin which allows using the key <tab> to insert completion. Works fine with JEDI-VIM.
